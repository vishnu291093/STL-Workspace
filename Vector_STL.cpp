/***
Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size.

Just like arrays, vectors use contiguous storage locations for their elements,
 which means that their elements can also be accessed using offsets on regular pointers to its elements,
 nd just as efficiently as in arrays. But unlike arrays, their size can change dynamically,
 with their storage being handled automatically by the container.

Internally, vectors use a dynamically allocated array to store their elements.
This array may need to be reallocated in order to grow in size when new elements are inserted,
which implies allocating a new array and moving all elements to it.
This is a relatively expensive task in terms of processing time, and thus, vectors do not reallocate each time an element is added to the container.

Instead, vector containers may allocate some extra storage to accommodate for possible growth,
and thus the container may have an actual capacity greater than the storage strictly needed to contain its elements
(i.e., its size). Libraries can implement different strategies for growth to balance between memory usage and reallocations,
 but in any case, reallocations should only happen at logarithmically growing intervals of size so that the insertion of individual
 elements at the end of the vector can be provided with amortized constant time complexity (see push_back).

Therefore, compared to arrays, vectors consume more memory in exchange for the ability to manage storage and grow dynamically in an efficient way.

Compared to the other dynamic sequence containers (deques, lists and forward_lists),
 vectors are very efficient accessing its elements (just like arrays) and relatively efficient adding or removing elements
 from its end. For operations that involve inserting or removing elements at positions other than the end, they perform worse than the others,
  and have less consistent iterators and references than lists and forward_lists.

//initialize a vector
std::vector<int> vec;
//vector of size 10
std::vector<int> vec2(10);
//vector of size 10 and intialized
std::vector<int> vec3(10,5);
//if out of range then throws an instance of std::out of range
//vec.at(11) = 32;
//addding element to the end of the vector
vec.push_back(10);
//Inorder to prevent the copying and increasing the size of the arrray
//you can use the method reserve
//If the vector already has room for the required number of elements,
//reserve() does nothing. In other words, reserve() will grow the allocated storage of the vector,
//if necessary, but will never shrink it.
//vec.reserve(10);
//o find out how many elements would fit in the currently allocated storage of a vector, use the capacity() member function.
// To find out how many elements are currently contained by the vector, use the size() member function:
std::cout<<vec.capacity()<<std::endl;
std::cout<<vec.size()<<std::endl;
//if we dont reserve the size then once it reaches max,The vector will copy it to another memory location of double the initial size

//The correct way of enlarging the number of contained elements is to call vector's member function resize()

//If the new size is larger than the old size of the vector, it will preserve all elements already present in the controlled sequence; t
//he rest will be initialized according to the second parameter. If the new size is smaller than the old size,
//it will preserve only the first new_size elements. The rest is discarded and shouldn't be used any moreâ€”consider these elements invalid.
//If the new size is larger than capacity(), it will reallocate storage so all new_size elements fit. resize() will never shrink capacity().

vec.clear();//vec is empty
vec.reserve(4);//capasity is 4
vec.push_back(23);// vec is 23
vec.resize(5); // vec is 23,0,0,0,0
vec.push_back(100);// vec is 23,0,0,0,0,100
vec.resize(2); //vec is 23,0
vec.resize(5,1); //vec is 23,0,1,1,1

//address of the first element of the vector can be got by

//we can pass that to function asking for a pointer to int or other type

//we can construct a vector by copying from an array

std::vector<double> a(p, p+5);

//Using pointer to point to an memmory address of a vecotr can be problemamtic as

//assign function

//The assign() function will reinitialize the vector. We can pass either a valid element range using the [first, last) iterators
//or we can specify the number of elements to be created and the element value.
vec.assign(a.begin(), a.end());

//pop_back(), that removes the last element in the controlled sequence.
 //The removed element becomes invalid, and size() is decremented.
//Note that pop_back() does not return the value of the popped element.
vec.pop_back();

std::vector<int>::reverse_iterator r = vec.rbegin();
// to get a normal iterator out, use base member function
std::vector<int>::iterator i = r.base();

vec.front();
//to acess the last element use
vec.back();

// it points to the inserted element
it = v.insert(it, 33);


    //insert the contents of q before the second element:
vec.insert(it, p.begin(), p.end());
// insert three time -1 before the fourth element:
